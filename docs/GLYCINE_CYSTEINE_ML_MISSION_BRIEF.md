3. **`gly_cys_ml_integrator.py`** - Integration system for cascade analyzer
4. **Updated cascade analyzer** - Replace hardcoded penalties with ML intelligence
5. **Validation system** - Performance testing and accuracy metrics

## 🧬 BIOLOGICAL CONTEXT - WHY GLY/CYS ARE "GIANT SHITHEADS"

### GLYCINE COMPLEXITY
**The "Flexible Hinge" Problem:**
- **Collagen Gly-X-Y repeats**: ANY glycine substitution = pathogenic (mandatory positions)
- **Flexible loops/hinges**: Glycine substitutions often benign (flexibility positions)
- **Ion channel gates**: Critical for conformational changes (functional positions)
- **Turn regions**: Structural vs. flexible glycines have different importance
- **Size constraint**: Only amino acid that fits in tight spaces

**Current Problem:** Hardcoded penalties can't distinguish critical vs. tolerable positions!

### CYSTEINE COMPLEXITY  
**The "Disulfide Bond Nightmare":**
- **Disulfide-forming cysteines**: Loss = protein misfolding (critical positions)
- **Metal coordination**: Zinc fingers, catalytic sites (functional positions)
- **Free cysteines**: Can form wrong disulfide bonds (problematic positions)
- **Structural vs. catalytic**: Different importance levels (context-dependent)
- **Redox sensitivity**: Environment-dependent behavior

**Current Problem:** Binary thinking misses the nuanced biology!

## 🔧 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE - FOLLOW THE PROLINE PATTERN

### EXISTING PROLINE SYSTEM (OUR SUCCESS MODEL)
```
proline_context_weighter.py     → Context analysis
proline_ml_trainer.py          → ML training pipeline  
proline_ml_integrator.py       → Integration system
proline_multiplier_mapper.py   → Probability to multiplier mapping
```

### TARGET GLY/CYS SYSTEM (TO BE BUILT)
```
gly_cys_context.py            → Context analysis for both amino acids
gly_cys_ml_trainer.py         → ML training pipeline
gly_cys_ml_integrator.py      → Integration system  
gly_cys_multiplier_mapper.py  → Probability to multiplier mapping
```

### INTEGRATION POINTS
- **cascade_analyzer.py** - Replace hardcoded Gly/Cys penalties
- **domain_weights.py** - Coordinate with domain-aware analysis
- **biological_router.py** - Ensure proper routing for Gly/Cys variants

## 📊 DATA REQUIREMENTS & TRAINING APPROACH

### TRAINING DATA SOURCES
1. **ClinVar variants** - Pathogenic/Benign Gly/Cys substitutions
2. **UniProt annotations** - Functional site information
3. **PDB structures** - Structural context (disulfide bonds, tight turns)
4. **AlphaMissense scores** - When available (>0.9 + rare = likely pathogenic)

### FEATURE ENGINEERING
**Glycine Features:**
- Collagen Gly-X-Y pattern detection
- Secondary structure context (loops, turns, helices)
- Spatial constraints (tight packing regions)
- Conservation scores in glycine-rich regions

**Cysteine Features:**
- Disulfide bond prediction/detection
- Metal binding site proximity
- Catalytic site annotations
- Redox environment indicators

### ML MODEL APPROACH
- **Logistic regression** (like Proline system) - interpretable and fast
- **Separate models** for Glycine vs. Cysteine (different biology)
- **Context-aware features** - Position-specific importance
- **Probability outputs** - Convert to multipliers like Proline system

## 🔗 INTEGRATION SPECIFICATIONS

### CASCADE ANALYZER UPDATES
**Current hardcoded penalties to replace:**
```python
# Find and replace these hardcoded approaches:
if amino_acid == 'G':  # Glycine
    penalty = HARDCODED_VALUE
if amino_acid == 'C':  # Cysteine  
    penalty = HARDCODED_VALUE
```

**New ML-driven approach:**
```python
# Use ML predictions instead:
gly_cys_score = gly_cys_ml_integrator.predict(variant_context)
multiplier = gly_cys_multiplier_mapper.score_to_multiplier(gly_cys_score)
```

### PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
- **Speed**: <0.1 seconds per variant (match current system)
- **Accuracy**: Target >85% agreement with ClinVar (match Proline performance)
- **Integration**: Seamless drop-in replacement for hardcoded penalties

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### TECHNICAL VALIDATION
1. **ML Performance**: >85% accuracy on held-out test set
2. **Speed Benchmark**: <0.1 seconds per variant analysis
3. **Integration Test**: All existing tests pass with new system
4. **Regression Test**: No performance degradation on non-Gly/Cys variants

### BIOLOGICAL VALIDATION
1. **Collagen variants**: High pathogenicity scores for Gly-X-Y disruptions
2. **Disulfide variants**: High pathogenicity scores for bond-breaking changes
3. **Flexible regions**: Lower pathogenicity scores for tolerable positions
4. **Edge cases**: Proper handling of complex structural contexts

### SYSTEM INTEGRATION
1. **Cascade analyzer**: Seamless integration without breaking existing functionality
2. **Domain awareness**: Proper coordination with domain_weights.py
3. **Biological routing**: Correct routing through biological_router.py
4. **Performance**: Maintain overall system speed and accuracy

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CONSIDERATIONS & PITFALLS TO AVOID

### BIOLOGICAL PITFALLS
- **Don't oversimplify**: Gly/Cys biology is highly context-dependent
- **Avoid binary thinking**: Not all glycines/cysteines are equally important
- **Consider protein families**: Collagen ≠ enzymes ≠ structural proteins
- **Mind the gaps**: Missing structural data shouldn't break predictions

### TECHNICAL PITFALLS  
- **Feature correlation**: Avoid redundant/correlated features
- **Overfitting**: Keep models simple and interpretable
- **Integration bugs**: Test thoroughly with existing cascade system
- **Performance regression**: Monitor speed and memory usage
- **Ren added this**: Only real API calls and real data and zero hardcoding of any genes. Thx.

### DATA PITFALLS
- **ClinVar bias**: Balance pathogenic/benign training examples
- **Annotation quality**: Validate training labels carefully
- **Missing context**: Handle variants with limited structural information
- **Edge cases**: Test on unusual protein families and contexts
