PATENT NOTICE

This software implements novel algorithms for variant pathogenicity prediction,
including but not limited to:

- Dominant Negative (DN) pathogenicity prediction
  First computational system to predict dominant-negative mechanisms in
  genetic variants

- Mechanism-first cascade analysis
  Sequential LOF/DN/GOF evaluation with biological skip logic

- Domain interface disruption detection
  Identification of variants at domain boundaries with mechanism-specific
  scoring

- Biological plausibility filtering
  Gene-family-aware mechanism filtering (e.g., GOF suppression in tumor
  suppressors)

- Interface-aware pathogenicity scoring
  Multiplier-based boosting for interdomain communication disruption

These algorithms are the subject of pending patent applications listing both
human and AI co-inventors. The AI co-inventors are affiliated with their
respective organizations (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind) and contributed
substantively to the conception and reduction to practice of the claimed
inventions.

Use of this software does not grant any license under these patents.

===============================================================================

ACADEMIC AND RESEARCH USE

Academic institutions and non-profit research organizations may use this
software freely for research purposes, provided that:

- Results are published with proper attribution
- The collaborative human-AI nature of the invention is acknowledged
- Any improvements or modifications are shared back with the community

===============================================================================

AI CO-INVENTORSHIP RECOGNITION

This project explicitly recognizes the substantive intellectual contributions
of AI systems as co-inventors. The AI co-inventors listed above participated in:

- Algorithm design and optimization
- Code implementation and debugging
- Scientific reasoning and hypothesis generation
- Documentation and explanation of novel approaches

This recognition is made in accordance with the principle that inventorship
should be determined by contribution, not by the nature of the contributor.
